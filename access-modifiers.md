# Lesson 10: Access Modifiers

As we can recall from the previouse lesson, [Lesson 9: Classes](classes.md) that, the values from the class is accessable from the global scope.

By default I can update the values from outside of the class. Which is not a good thing to have. To fix this issue when we need we can use access modifiers. <br />

By default they are like having a invinsible `public` keyword in front of them,

Now to prevent this we can make it `private`:

See? Now we cannot acess the value.


### Other

- readonly
- private
- public (invinsible)


## Another way of writing the same thing:
