# Lesson 11: Module System

- So far what we have done is done by the `script.js` file kept inside `index.html` in the root directory,
- But in larger applications it is done in a smaller moduler system. How to do that on TS?
- Mordern browsers supports this moduler system by default within the browsers. But the older ones might not support that.
- Update the config file. change the `target` file from `es5` to `es6`. Also update the `module` from `commonjs` to `es2015` (Since, the module system was introduced during that time). Add `type="module"` in the `index.html` file (for the browser).
- To import a module to another file of code we need to make some changes.
