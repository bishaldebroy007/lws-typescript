# Lesson 1: Intro to TypeScript

- TypeScript is basically a superset (Made on top of JavaScript) of JavaScript created by Microsoft.
- Allows static strict typing.
- Extra features - interfaces, enums, tuples, generics.
- It supports modern features (arrow functions, let, const).
- Based on the .NET Harmony specification.

## What was wrong with JavaScript
- Not suitable for large applications/enterprise-based applications,
- Lacks strong typing,
- Weird inheritance, unfamiliar syntax.
- Only errors during runtime. But Typescript gives us a compile-time error.
- Suffers type coercion.

## Benefits of TypeScript
- Typescript = JavaScript.
- Compiles to JS - runs everywhere.
- Familiar Object Oriented programming.
- New Features work everywhere.

## Installing TS on System
- Install Node.js in the system,
- Install Typescript compiler

```bash
npm i -g typescript
```
